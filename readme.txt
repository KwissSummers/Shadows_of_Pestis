The protagonist of the story is a character named The Doctor, one of the members of the Physicianâ€™s Vanguard, 
a secret agency dedicated to fighting the plague. Their universe is set in a medieval fantasy world inflicted with the 
Shadow Plague. A pestilence that kills most living beings it comes in contact with while causing mutation in others. 
The doctor, after being hired by a village recently struck by the plague, must embark on a quest to slay the source of the 
plague, an eldritch monstrosity dubbed The Harbinger of the Plague, whose ultimate goal is to wipe out humanity. 
The Doctor tracks down the Harbinger and delves into its lair to slay it and its plague-infested minions.
