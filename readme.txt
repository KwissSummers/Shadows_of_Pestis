Use the arrow keys to move around.
For a bit more movement, dash around by pressing Z.
If a monster tries to attack, attack it back using the X key to slash.
To use a ranged attack, you need to gain charges. To gain charges, you can:
- Hit enemies
- Hold V to charge
Once you have a charge, press C to shoot a ranged attack in the direction you are facing.

Cheat Codes:
D: Go to the dev room (nothing much to do here)
H: Heal back to full
N: Go to the next room
R: Reset the current room
